# Clasp configuration files

A Clasp project uses the following configuration files:

File | Default | Description
--- | --- | ---
Clasp project file | `./.clasp.json` | Define which Apps Script project to interact with (and how)
Clasp ignore file | `.claspignore` in the same directory as the Clasp project file | Specifies files to ignore by `push` and `watch` Clasp commands
Google Auth file | `~/.clasprc.json` (global) or `.clasprc.json` in the same directory as the Clasp project file (local) | OAuth 2.0 authentication and authorization to access Google APIs. Authentication is global by default.
Apps Script project manifest | `<rootDir>/appsscript.json` | Specifies basic project information (cf. [Manifests](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/concepts/manifests))
Typescript configuration file | `<rootDir>/tsconfig.json` | Used for user specific compiling options. Limited support.

## Environment variables

Environment variables can be set in order to set the following default files:

File | Environment varaiable | Comment

Clasp ignore file | `clasp_config_ignore` |
Google Auth file | `clasp_config_auth` | The filename must start with a dot '.'
