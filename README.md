# clasp

Develop [Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/) projects locally using clasp (*C*ommand *L*ine *A*pps *S*cript *P*rojects).

**To get started, try out the [codelab](https://g.co/codelabs/clasp)!**

### Install

First download `clasp`:

```sh
npm i @google/clasp -g
```

Then enable Apps Script API: https://script.google.com/home/usersettings

### Features

**üó∫Ô∏è Develop Locally:** `clasp` allows you to develop your Apps Script projects locally. That means you can check-in your code into source control, collaborate with other developers, and use your favorite tools to develop Apps Script.

**üî¢ Manage Deployment Versions:** Create, update, and view your multiple deployments of your project.

**üìÅ Structure Code:** `clasp` automatically converts your flat project on [script.google.com](script.google.com) into **folders**. For example:
- _On script.google.com_:
  - `tests/slides.gs`
  - `tests/sheets.gs`
- _locally_:
  - `tests/`
    - `slides.js`
    - `sheets.js`

## Commands

```sh
clasp
```
- `clasp login [--no-localhost]`
- `clasp logout`
- `clasp create [scriptTitle] [scriptParentId]`
- `clasp clone <scriptId>`
- `clasp pull`
- `clasp push`
- `clasp open`
- `clasp deployments`
- `clasp deploy [version] [description]`
- `clasp redeploy <deploymentId> <version> <description>`
- `clasp version [description]`
- `clasp versions`

## How To...

### Login/Logout
```
clasp login
clasp logout
```

Run `clasp login --no-localhost` to manually enter a code instead of running a local server.

### Create a New Apps Script Project

Files in the current directory are added to the project. Optinally provide a script title or parent G Suite doc ID.

```
clasp create [scriptTitle] [scriptParentId]
```

### Clone an existing project in the current directory

```
clasp clone <scriptId>
```

### Push/Pull

```
clasp push # Updates Apps Script project with local files
clasp pull # Updates local files with Apps Script project
```

### Update a Published Project / Deploy

To deploy a project:

1. Create an immutable version of the Apps Script project using `clasp version`
1. Deploy the version using `clasp deploy [version]`

```
clasp versions # List versions
clasp version [description] # Create a new version with a description
```

then deploy...

```
clasp deploy [version] [description]
clasp undeploy <deploymentId>
clasp deployments # List all deployment IDs
```

### Open the project on script.google.com

```
clasp open
```

### Ignore Files

Create a file called `.claspignore` in the root directory of your Apps Script project. Add patterns as if it were a .gitignore, and they will be excluded from `clasp push`.  

A sample `.claspignore` could look like:

```
**/**
!build/Main.js
!appsscript.json
```
This file ignores everything but the manifest and the bundle.

Note: the `.claspignore` file is parsed with [Anymatch](https://github.com/micromatch/anymatch), making it match files differently from a typical `.gitignore`, especially with directories. To ignore a directory, use syntax like `**/node_modules/**`

### Configuration

When running `clone` or `create`, a file named `.clasp.json` is created in the current directory to describe clasp's configuration for the current project. The following configuration values can be used in it.

#### `scriptId` (required)

Specifies the id of the Google Script project that clasp will target. It is the part located inbetween `/d/` and `/edit` in your project's URL: `https://script.google.com/d/<SCRIPT_ID>/edit`.

#### `rootDir` (optional)

Specifies the **local** directory in which clasp will store your project files. If not specified, clasp will default to the current directory.

## Troubleshooting

The library requires Node version >= 4.7.4.

```sh
node -v # Check Node version
sudo npm install n -g
sudo n latest
```

## Develop

The Apps Script CLI uses TypeScript to provide autocompletion and linting when developing.
Use an IDE like **Visual Studio Code** for TypeScript autocompletion.

### Setup

Install `tsc`: `npm install -g typescript`

### After Making a Change

```sh
npm run build;
clasp <command>
```

### Submitting a Pull Request

1. Look over the test cases in `test.sh`, try cases that the PR may affect.
1. Run [tslint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/): `npm run lint`.
1. Submit a pull request after testing and linting.

## Publish

1. Build `index.js` locally. `.gitignore`/`.npmignore` will hide js/ts files appropriately.
1. Bump versions, then publish with: `npm publish --access public`
